# webSonda 0.1

I am using Maven2. 

Execute in Linux with root
apt-get install maven2 to install maven2, after, execute mvn test to test de application.

Use mvn exec:java and access your browser localhost:8080.

Can you to use a 'curl -X POST -d '{"commands": "5 5 \n 1 2 N \n LMLMLMLMM"}' localhost:8080' to visualize result.
Use \n to do a breakline.
